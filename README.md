# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning.
## Contents
- ### Machine Learning
	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/truongminhphung/Advance-House-Price-Prediction): Based on house features, apply some statistical tools to analyze data,preprocess data, visualize data. Build the machine learning model that can predict the price of the house.
 

- ### Micro Projects:
	- [ML with Logistic Regression_1](https://github.com/truongminhphung/Data-science-portfolio/blob/master/ML_micro_project/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb): In this project, i am going to build a model to indicate whether or not a particular internet user click on an advertisement. This is a binary classification so logistic regression is the best algorithm to apply.
	- [ML with Logistic Regression_2](https://github.com/truongminhphung/Data-science-portfolio/tree/master/ML_micro_project/logistic_reg): This mini project will apply logistic regression to solve problem in real-world. HR department wants to build a model automatically making prediction to see whether s.o will leave their position, based on these results the firm can meet their needs to take them stay in.
	- [Ml with decision tree](https://github.com/truongminhphung/Data-science-portfolio/blob/master/ML_micro_project/decision%20tree/Titanic_Decisiontree.ipynb): In this mini project, i will apply decision tree algorithm in the famous dataset - titanic dataset to predict survival people based on features. I also use technique called hyperparameter tuning to optimize the accuracy of my model
